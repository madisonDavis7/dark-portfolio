## ✨New Portfolio✨ (work in progress)

**Summary**
I decided I didn't like the aesthetic of my old portfolio and wanted to challenge myself to create a new one in less time than the previous one. I made my old one about a year ago and have learned a lot since then. For this one 
I wanted it to feel cleaner and have a darker more cyberpunk feel to it. I needed a better way to split up my work, have a section for my web apps and another section for my design work. 

I wanted it to better reflect my aesthetic preference and minimalistic designs

I wanted the options of darkmode and lightmode

I like designing and have too many portfolio ideas

This was built with the intention of being viewer on a laptop or desktop

## Goals ##
1. Have a visually appealing site with a consistent theme
2. Treat the process as I would any other client
3. Have better organization for my projects and showcase my designs clearly

## Challenges ##
- Making sure the design works on all screen sizes
- Getting a popup modal to work with the poster designs
- Having smooth scrolling for the carousel
- sticking to a schedule and not getting side tracked with other projects
