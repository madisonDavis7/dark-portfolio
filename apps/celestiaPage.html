        <p>This was an individual project done in my third year of college for a web development class. This project utilized React and Ionic. React was a new tool and there was quite a learning curve for me regarding it. I had never worked with a framework like it 
                before, but it proved very beneficial and has helped me many times since. regarding the design, I wanted it to be a clean and simple informative app. I didn't want a ton of 
                text, and instead wanted the focus to be on the visuals and interactivity of the app. When creating this I had younger kids in mind, so I wanted lots of colors, a map that could be 
                played with, and an interface that was easy to navigate. </p>

            <p>Over the span of this project I faced several setbacks and challenges. This was my first time working wtih React and Typescript so there was quite a learning curve 
                in terms of understanding the structure, syntax, and best practices. I utilized many resources including official documentation, my professor, and online forums. This was a beneficial skill 
                though and I've contuined to use React since. I had ran into issues with my API integration, but after many hours of debugging and switching APIs I was able to get it 
                successfully working.
