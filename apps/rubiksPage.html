          This was my first complete Java project. It is a command line application where users input random moves to scramble a Rubik's cube, and the program outputs the moves 
          needed to solve the scrambled cube. This was done for a programming class in my second year of college and was a great introduction to object-oriented programming, arrays, CLIs, amd 
          much more.

          This specific project took a few weeks to complete. I began by planning out my process and getting an idea of what functions would be needed. I utilized many resources, including classmates, online forums, and my profeessor. 
          There were many late nights and many times I didn't think I could do it, but pushing through and reminding myself I was still learning let me build a successful program. This was one of the 
          key projects and experiences that made me want to continue pursuing a career in software development.
